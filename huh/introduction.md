# Introduction

With the advent of Bitcoin [(Nakamoto, 2009)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_bitcoinwhitepaper), the Byzantine fault tolerance problem was solved with the marvel blockchain technology, and the first wave of disruption appeared. Among many new possibilities, decentralized finances became viable for the first time. Anthropologically speaking, the sequence: speech - write - the printing press - the internet and now the blockchain are arguably the most relevant breakthroughs turning unconscious beings ever increasingly more conscious.

A second wave of disruption came with the implementation of smart contracts built on the blockchain technology [(Buterin, 2015)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_ethereumwhitepaper). Among yet many new possibilities, decentralized computing and legislation by means of automatically executable clauses became not only viable but may have also anticipated the course of history. Among the present challenges of this technology, a compromise between decentralization and computing cost has been identified.

In order to reduce computational costs at the expense of decentralization, layer 2 networks have since then been advocated. Binance Smart Chain [(“Binance Smart Chain whitepaper”, 2020)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_bscwhitepaper) and the Matic, (now Polygon) [(“Matic Whitepaper”, 2018)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_maticwhitepaper) are great examples of L2 successful networks. The variety of blockchain protocols has been compared to the variety of life forms boosted in the pre-Cambrian period of life evolution on Earth, similarly now, a multitude of cryptocurrencies have evolved.

Among these many cryptocurrencies a special project [(Reflect.finance, 2021)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_reflectfinance) was the first to develop the novel concept of reflection as a means to incentivize participants of the network to adopt positive behaviours towards the protocol and community growth. HUH embraces this work.

Although technological advancements are instrumental in many aspects of life, humans are social beings. Facebook, (now Metaverse) explored this avenue quite successfully until recently (Facebook, 2020), when its business model was considered outdated by many members of the community already under strong influence from the cryptocurrencies’ life explosion. Somebody else’s data ownership is now considered a much more serious topic than a decade ago, smart contracts have been frequently called to the rescue with the advent of NFT protocols. Above all, with all these technicalities we, as social beings, live statistically better and longer when interconnected with quality relationships. At HUH it is believed that a key aspect in these relationships is the promotion of humour and emotions generally, as a solid building block able to give colour and pleasant perfume to life. In this context the HUH cryptocurrency was conceived.&#x20;

Have fun, start living a fulfilling life - HUH.

## HUH DREAM

> #### _“Never stop dreaming!_”

Winston Churchill

To create a fair world for everyone, to rebalance the social order and create a sustainable environment for generations to come.  &#x20;

> #### “To give is always better than to receive”

Clara Tee

And HUH is the token that keeps on giving: _to us, to our children and our planet_.

## HUH VISION

Creation of the world’s first “UTIMEME” cryptocurrency combining the power of ‘meme’ tokens with the useability of utility tokens. To catalyse the creation of a meaningful social network called ‘MetHUH’ where users’ data ownership is taken seriously from a cryptocurrency first perspective. With the HUH social network, MetHUH, a whole new world of possibilities is unlocked where not only financial value but also social value is transacted. Meet MetHUH’s novel sentiment blockchain.

### Why HUH?

Because it is the most commonly used word in the world. This particular word connects people together with impact, enthusiasm and fun.

## HUH THINKING

The success of open source decentralised “meme” cryptocurrencies has broken records and overshadowed some of the most long-standing cryptocurrencies classified as “utility” and/or “exchange”. To date meme cryptocurrencies have enjoyed the public’s attention and have gained an immense following. With two of them already having a combined market cap greater than some of the top 15 cryptocurrencies in the world. One of the key issues, however, is their inability to ever scale beyond their “meme” status. More elaborated use cases are not present in most of these tokens and many slowly lose traction once the hype has died. Seasoned investors frequently avoid these cryptocurrencies.

At HUH the key concepts that make meme tokens so successful have been investigated alongside the cause-and-effect relations generally associated with the longevity of utilitarian tokens. HUH Token merges these concepts together and creates the world’s first “UTIMEME” cryptocurrency. A token created with the tokenomics of a meme cryptocurrency but with clear useability of an entire harmonic ecosystem that enables a multitude of growth possibilities.&#x20;

The more possibilities we have to grow the better - HUH?

HUH are committed to promote a fertile ground for multidimensional growth in the dimensions that matter to you. HUH respects your values, your seed, your legacy, therefore we invite you to lead each one.

Come and start seeding with HUH, there is plenty room for growth.
