# HUH Governance

We at HUH believe that each vote counts, but vote quality and stake count as well. Therefore, HUH Governance is designed to be facilitated by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) using mostly a novel consensus strategy where vote quality is not compromised, at the expense of increased complexity, called ConSenseUs (CSU).

## HUH DAOs

The default consensus strategy throughout the entire HUH ecosystem is ConSenseUs. HUH DAOs may resort to legacy Plutocracy, Meritocracy, Democracy consensus strategies whenever the community sees fit as a fallback mechanism in order to achieve faster resolutions. The minimum requirement for a HUH DAO to be born is a constitution and an entity presentation article. HUH DAO development kit will support HUH entities (HUH DAOs, users or federations) on the creation of a HUH DAO constitution and presentation article.

## HUH ConSenseUs (CSU)



HUH entities willing to participate in HUH’s governance should expect that a vote quality assessment will be conducted for most DAO voting processes. The quality of a vote will be modelled initially as a bidimensional feature depending on:

* the consciousness level the voter has on the subject under voting associated with the concerning knowledge fields
* the voter’s stake

The heatmap of the figure 6 shows the vote quality change depending on the consciousness and stake a voter has.

A technology based on the [Consider.it](https://consider.it) system is being developed to run our main consensus strategy CSU in order to reach DAOs outcomes. The stake is calculated by the formula in Equation 1.

Where:

* ∆t = token time lock period
* amountlockedtokens = amount of tokens staked in the token time lock contract.

## HUH Federations

Federated child organizations may form a HUH federation. A HUH federation is any DAO in which at least two different member entities are also a DAO. The purpose of a HUH federation is to lead around common values among federated entities. The union of federations and organizations is promoted by means of a system designed to reward union tokens to cohesive behaviours. The more behaviours provenly associated with strengthening the union and combating division within the community more HUH union tokens will be granted to the responsible entity.

A strong union observed by HUH entities is analogous to the concept behind a tree where strong roots, trunk and associated branches with happy green leaves are instrumental to achieve sustainable growth.

## HUH Improvement Proposals (HIP)

In GitHub, HUH Improvement Proposals (HIP) are to be discussed together with the community by means of pull requests. We are researching the integration of consensus strategies with GitHub through GitHub applications.
