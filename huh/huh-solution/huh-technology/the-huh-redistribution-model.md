# The HUH redistribution model

The reflection system in HUH is a reward system that rewards the holders of HUH Token based on the percentage of their holdings. For example: if user A is holding 0.5% of the supply that means 0.5% of the HUH rewards will be reflected to user A.

This ensures that all HUH token holders and investors are fairly rewarded for their trust in the HUH metaverse. The number of HUH tokens to be reflected is based on the aggregation of all buy and sell transactions on the HUH network. This is set out in more detail in the ‘tax system’ section set out below.
