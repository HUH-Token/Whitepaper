# HUH Technology

HUH is the next evolution of a yield-generating contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and on the Ethereum chain. HUH rewards the HUH token holding community by re-distributing HUH through a novel technology called reflection (see above Reflect.finance, 2021).

The smart contract enhances a static rewards system incentivising its network users to hold the HUH token, thus minimizing the risk of major price fluctuations as a result of market swings.
