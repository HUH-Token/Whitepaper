# HUH SOLUTION

## Step One 'meme':

Each HUH Token represents a real-time yield delivery system that seamlessly compounds HUH Tokens in their wallets. The exact amount of the re-distribution depends on many factors and can be monitored in real-time on the HUH Dashboard. Full details of the tokenomics set out below.

## **Step Two 'utility':**

HUH will create an entire ecosystem around the HUH token to create real usability and utility for the token itself. The HUH app will empower influencers by letting them interact with each other and the companies that want to work with them without a middleman. In addition, an NFT social media marketplace will be created where users can bid, auction and buy NFT’s from their favourite HUH influencers. Influencers can create NFT’s out of their media with the click of a button, setting the price themselves and then auctioning these NFT’s on the HUH app. Users can buy and collect these NFT’s and resell them within the HUH Marketplace.

Influencers have their own individual followings and communities, the content they upload to their social media platforms receive likes and comments from their fans. HUH will use these statistics to form what we call “Influence Points”. This will be a number given to each influencer on our platform and will be used to determine their NFT’s value. The higher the Influence Points the more valuable their NFT will be. This is so users can easily understand an influencers NFT’s value when interacting within the marketplace.

The NFTs are “minted” using blockchain technology, which creates property rights on digital properties. When a user decides to buy an influencer’s NFT the NFT’s are minted using their HUH Tokens. Each buy and sell of these NFT’s within the marketplace is facilitated by the use of HUH Tokens. This organically increases the volume and indirectly increases the reflection of HUH Tokens to the community.
