# HUH SOLUTION

HUH applies circular economy concepts in order to help influencers to reach their target audience with desired impact, sentiment and compensation.&#x20;

HUH users’ data is modelled with smart contract technologies including NFTs. Whenever there is a sale associated with the HUH user’s own data, a reward transaction is sent to the HUH user’s account.&#x20;

HUH promotes the creation of income for every token holding member of the MetHUH using a unique referral system integrated within the smart contract. Anyone can create and share a referral code to generate returns for their tokens.&#x20;

As in all such programmes, returns are dependent on the number of HUH tokens holding members have.&#x20;

HUH token is based on a ‘fair redistribution’ model where larger investments in tokens will yield larger returns, and equally the greater the number referrals the more rewards are earned.&#x20;

In simple terms if someone holds HUH, they will earn more HUH.&#x20;

Holders do not need to stake or wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by the smart contract and are immediately reflected in the holder’s HUH token balance.&#x20;

### HUH PLAN

#### Step One 'meme':

Each HUH Token represents a real-time yield delivery system that seamlessly compounds HUH Tokens in their wallets. The exact amount of the re-distribution depends on many factors and can be monitored in real-time on the HUH Dashboard. Full details of the tokenomics set out below. In addition, there is a referral reward system to enable everyone to generate HUH tokens: be they in a swarming metropolis like New York or a small African village if they have internet access, they can generate HUH tokens; and as part of the ‘rebalancing process’ HUH will be facilitating access to technology for everyone, everywhere.

#### **Step Two 'utility':**

HUH will create an entire ecosystem around the HUH token to create real usability and utility for the token itself: the MetHUH. In the MetHUH social influencers will be empowered to interact with each other and the companies that want to work with them without a middleman. In addition, an NFT social media marketplace will be created on the MetHUH where users can bid, auction and buy NFT’s from their favourite social influencers. Social influencers will be able to create NFT’s out of their own content/media with the click of a button, setting the price themselves and then auctioning these NFT’s on the MetHUH. Users can buy and collect these NFT’s and resell them within the MetHUH.&#x20;

Social influencers have their own individual followings and communities, the content they upload to their social media platforms receive likes and comments from their fans. HUH will use these statistics to form what we call “Influence Points”. This will be a number given to each social influencer on the MetHUH and will be used to determine their NFT’s value. The higher the Influence Points the more valuable their NFT will be. This enables users to easily understand a social influencer’s NFT’s value when interacting within the MetHUH.&#x20;

The NFTs are “minted” using blockchain technology, which creates property rights on digital properties. When a user decides to buy a social influencer’s NFT the NFT’s are minted using their HUH Tokens. Each buy and sell of these NFT’s within the marketplace is facilitated by the use of HUH Tokens. This organically increases the volume and indirectly increases the reflection of HUH Tokens to the community. &#x20;

Separately but no less importantly within the MetHUH Sentiment tokens can be generated based on the content and, indeed, sentiment of the social influencer’s posts. These for a separate but no less important rewards will make the social media universe a safer and more friendly environment for all.  Rewards drive behaviour and HUH will be the catalyst for social equality.
