# MetHUH technology

In MetHUH, content is made available to the public on behalf of social intelligent agents (SIA) called producers, regardless if based on carbon or silicon. Other SIAs, consumers, consume the content on the MetHUH platform. Both content production and consumption are evaluated with sentiment analysis being carried out by initially both IBM Watson and Google Perspective API comment analysers [(Perspective API, 2020)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_perspectiveapi), [(IBM, 2018)](https://huh-token.gitbook.io/untitled/55QN1dmMDJKBzRVZ0szS/additional-info/references#references\_ibmwatsontoneanalyser). With this particular meta information, the sentiment analysis report attached to SIA’s MetHUH session, sentiment tokens are awarded by MetHUH to SIA’s account accordingly depending on detected traits.

The following traits are modeled as tone tokens:

* Anger
* Fear
* Joy
* Sadness
* Confident
* Tentative

The following traits are modeled as moderation tokens:

* Toxicity
* Severe toxicity
* Identity attack
* Insult
* Profanity
* Threat

Whenever a SIA posts written content to the MetHUH platform, a transaction with the detected levels of tone and moderation tokens is sent to MetHUH SIA’s account. MetHUH technology is within the major utility branch under HUH, therefore all the sentiment tokens are an inherent part of the HUH ecosystem. As such SIAs will be able to trade their sentiment tokens for HUH and vice versa.
