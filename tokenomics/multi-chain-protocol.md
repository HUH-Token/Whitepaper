# Multi-chain protocol



The HUH token is available on more than one blockchain. Each blockchain HUH is on has its own strong points that allows the HUH ecosystem to thrive on it. As of right now, HUH will be made available on the following blockchains:&#x20;

* Ethereum
* Binance Smart Chain

HUH will be launched on the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchains. HUH has planned bringing liquidity to pools on strategic decentralised exchanges while ensuring that total circulating supply across all chains never exceeds 888B tokens as originally promised. There will be an ETH-BSC bridge with a 1:1 swap for HUH holders to move seamlessly between the two original chains. Due to the 1:1 swap, the supply and price of HUH between chains are intertwined. The Fees System is not applied to bridging. This means user’s won’t pay HUH transaction fees when moving tokens between the ETH and BSC chains. Users will only pay fees when doing usual transactions. As a market positioning strategy, HUH token is meant to be ubiquitous. That is why we will be extending HUH token to as many blockchains as possible.
