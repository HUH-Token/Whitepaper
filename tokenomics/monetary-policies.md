## Financial Instruments

The following financial instruments are subject to the control of the MPC:

* Market making partners and algorithms

* HUH Derivatives

The smart contracts upgradeability feature will not be available at v1 smart contracts launch. This is planned to be launched on v2 smart contracts release.

### Token burns

HUH Token has a burn wallet in Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchains. When tokens are sent to the burn wallet, they are taken out of circulation forever, making the circulating tokens more valuable due to an increase in scarcity. HUH Token is designed to present a deflationary trait by means of its ecosystem dynamics, as opposed to traditional government backed fiat-currencies, it is expected to become more valuable as time goes by due to, among many other reasons, scheduled token burns. The schedule of token burns and the amount of tokens burned at each transaction are going to be made available to the community by the MPC.
