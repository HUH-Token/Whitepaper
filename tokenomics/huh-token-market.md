# HUH Token Market

The initial plan for the token launch is to issue it on both PancakeSwap and UniSwap at the same time.

Once we have successfully launched on the decentralised exchanges (DEXâ€™s) then we will be in direct contact in getting listed on both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. This will allow us to have a much greater reach in the crypto community and allow us to create the HUH Nation faster.

We are aiming to receive Legal Opinions (LO) from multiple regions to guarantee listings on multiple exchanges. The Legal Opinions we are looking to generate are from the United Kingdom, USA, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Malta and Gibraltar as to name a few.

To create the volume needed to be listed on CG and CMC we will need to generate in the first day between $30,000 and $50,000.\
To get listed on the Tier 3 exchanges we will need to provide a daily trade volume of between $100,000 - $500,000.\
To get listed on the Tier 2 and Tier 1 exchanges we will need to provide a daily trading volume over $5,000,000.
