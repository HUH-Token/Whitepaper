# HUH Token Market

The initial plan for the token launch is to issue it on both PancakeSwap and UniSwap at the same time.&#x20;

Once HUH have successfully launched on the decentralised exchanges (DEXâ€™s) then it will be in direct contact in getting listed on both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. This will allow HUH to have a much greater reach in the crypto community and enable the creation of the HUH Nation faster.&#x20;

HUH is aiming to receive Legal Opinions from multiple regions to guarantee listings on multiple exchanges. The Legal Opinions we are looking to generate are initially from the United Kingdom, USA, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Malta and Gibraltar.&#x20;

To create the volume needed to be listed on CG and CMC HUH need to generate in the first day between $30,000 and $50,000. &#x20;

To get listed on the Tier 3 exchanges HUH need to provide a daily trade volume of between $100,000 - $500,000.&#x20;

To get listed on the Tier 2 and Tier 1 exchanges HUH need to provide a daily trading volume over $5,000,000.
