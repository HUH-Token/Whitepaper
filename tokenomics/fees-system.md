# Fees System

On every buy and sell transaction within the HUH token ecosystem, fees are deducted in the best interest of the community as a whole.&#x20;

HUH token fees were designed to cover 4 different purposes set out below:

1\. Payment of the implicit cost of the reflection feature. It is responsible to directly reward HUH token holders;

2\. Payment of LP acquisition costs;

3\. Payment of referral rewards, this is a ‘take once’ fee, and it is deducted on the first buy only; and

4\. Investments in marketing, designed to position HUH strategically with both depth and extension impacts. These investments indirectly guarantee sufficient resources to market and run the entire HUH ecosystem.
