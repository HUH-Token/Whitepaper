# THE MetHUH SENTIMENT TOKENS

In MetHUH, content is created by social influencers and made available to users on their behalf. Users, consume the content on MetHUH. Both content production and consumption are evaluated with sentiment analysis being carried out by an AI based evaluation carried out by systems like IBM Watson and Google Perspective using comment analysers.

* Light, tone and moderation traits are a subject of deep research on the field of sentiment analysis. HUH aim to strongly collaborate together with partners to achieve the functionality extension.&#x20;

Whenever a social influencer‚Äôs posts content to, or a user views content on, the MetHUH, a transaction with the detected levels of tone, moderation and light tokens is sent to social influencer‚Äôs/user‚Äôs account. MetHUH technology detects tone, moderation and light traits in the posted content using an ever-evolving algorithm and mint sentiment tokens which form an inherent part of the HUH ecosystem.&#x20;

The sentiment tokens are classified as:&#x20;

* Tone&#x20;
* Moderation&#x20;
* Light&#x20;

As such social influencers and the viewers of their content, users, will be able to earn sentiment tokens and trade them for HUH tokens. The dynamics involved effectively increase HUH token volume in exchanges and positions HUH as a unique value proposition in any cryptocurrency assets portfolio. HUH treasury will apply a percentage of the working capital buying and burning Ô∏è‚Äç‚Äç‚Äçüî• sentiment tokens associated with the most demanded traits by the community.&#x20;

Community members are incentivized to earn light tokens by producing and consuming content because, among other factors, light tokens earned will be financially valuable by HUH's governance by means of conducting the sentiment tokens monetary policy.&#x20;

Buying sentiment tokens from exchanges then burning them is one important instrument that concretely gives financial value to token holders.&#x20;

Community members are also incentivized to participate in HUH's governance collectively deciding which sentiment tokens will be valued the most. HUH believe circular economy researchers are key here in maximizing multidimensional growth.&#x20;

## Defend Science&#x20;

From all the light tokens there is one of special community interest called defend science. HUH believe that only with quality scientific methodology communities are able to effectively curate ideas and combat fake news.&#x20;

> _‚ÄúLife is something beautiful. Nature too, and your body (your boat, if you prefer, because you are the captain of your boat), is a part of this nature. The more you understand nature, the better you will understand your body. For that you don't have to be a scientist, a doctor or a university professor. Just be yourself, with your brain between your ears and always testing and asking the things behind. So, you will soon understand better what is going around. Stay safe and take care of yourself.‚Äù_
