# HUH token protection

HUH issues initial liquidity provided as ‘LP tokens’ and locks them for 2 years as an effective strategy to maintain robust liquidity at all times. DxLock rather will be used as a third-party facilitator to ensure that all LP tokens are locked in a secure and safe vault. LP tokens are generated with every trade and are also locked on transactions using Pancake Swap exchange solutions. These instruments dampen volatility and therefore bring greater stability especially when relevant volume transactions take place.&#x20;

Periodical smart contract audits are planned on a yearly basis. Three security/blockchain/smart contract audits have already been realised. Certik, Solidity.Finance and ShellBox’s. Additionally, HUH is committed to keep a bug bounty campaign always active and healthy in order to explore the search space and mitigate potential vulnerabilities reliably and fast. The HUH token protection is subject to the HUH security committee.

## HUH Security Committee

The security committee is responsible to react appropriately to all security reports brought to its attention. It has autonomy to drastically intervene on policies under execution by the executive team in order to guarantee security is not left aside. The community has a vital role in exploring the search space for potential vulnerabilities and in collectively curating ideas. HUH expect a balanced and strong alliance - community - security committee.

## Bug bounty campaign

White hat hackers are more than welcome to contribute by submitting their findings to [bounty at social.huh](mailto:bounty@social.huh). We as a team invite the community to gradually become more involved with HUH's governance. Aligned with this policy, pull requests to the bug bounty campaign documents are welcome as well [here](https://github.com/HUH-Token/bug-bounty-campaign-docs/tree/development).
