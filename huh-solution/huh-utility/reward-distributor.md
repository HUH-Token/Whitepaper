# Reward Distributor

The Reward Distributor is a utility smart contract built to handle the referral rewards. The Reward Distributor is equipped with features and functions that are useful when claiming rewards.

## Features of the Reward Distributor

**Claim rewards**: This, by default, claims the rewards in BNB and sends it to the relevant wallet of the reward holder.&#x20;

Claim rewards in desired token of choice (E.g., USDT, BUSD, ETH, MATIC, etc): This allows the reward holder to claim rewards in whichever token or coin they choose.&#x20;

**Claim rewards to another wallet**: This allows the reward holder to use a different wallet to receive their tokens.&#x20;

**Claim rewards in desired token to another wallet**: This gives the ability to reward holders to claim rewards in whichever token they select and then, subsequently, send it to another wallet they specify.&#x20;

**Gift Rewards**: This allows reward holders to gift any amount out of their rewards to another HUH user and thereby proliferate the art of giving.&#x20;
