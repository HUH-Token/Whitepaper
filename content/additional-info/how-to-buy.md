#### **Using Metamask**

One of the first tasks you will want to do on Metamask is to install a wallet to hold your cryptocurrencies. To do this, follow the instructions below.

**Step 1.** Click on the Metamask logo in the upper right hand corner of your Google chrome browser.

**Step 2.** Read and agree to the terms and conditions. You may have to agree to 2 to 3 pages worth of terms.

**Step 3.** Enter a password and click “Create” to create your wallet.

**Step 4.** You will see a set of 12 “seed words” for your vault. Click “Save Seed Words as File” and copy the “MetaMask Seed Words” file that is downloaded to a safe place. You will need it to access your wallet on another device, if something ever happens to the device you are currently downloading Metamask on.

You now have a wallet to use!

## Buying on PancakeSwap

**Step 1.** Go to the following link: [https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xc15e89f2149bCC0cBd5FB204C9e77fe878f1e9b2](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xc15e89f2149bCC0cBd5FB204C9e77fe878f1e9b2)

**Step 2:** Click "Connect Wallet."

**Step 3.** Click the Metamask tab.

**Step 4.** Enter your Metamask password and click unlock.

**Step 5.** Follow the prompts to finish the connection process.

Once you have connected your wallet, you are ready to purchase $HUH. Please remember that you need BNB in your Metamask wallet to pay for the gas fees. You can purchase BNB directly from your Metamask wallet, if you would like. You can also purchase BNB from an exchange, such as Coinbase, and send your BNB to your Metamask wallet. All you need to do is go to your preferred exchange and initiate a transfer from that exchange to your Metamask wallet address. Your Metamask wallet address can be found at the top of your Metamask wallet user interface.
